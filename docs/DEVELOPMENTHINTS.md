# Development Hints

## Deployment & Debugging with Android Studio

The following commands descripe how to deploy and debug the Demo App. 

Change into Demo App root:
1. Run `npm install` one time
2. Run `npm run ionic -- cordova prepare` one time
3. Open the directory `/platforms/android` with Android Studio to deploy the application and take advantage of the visual IDE debugger 
4. Edit plugin in IDEA. Add and remove plugin with `check_plugin.py` to transfer changed into Demo App project.

## Check Plugin Python Script

The Python script `check_plugin.py` can be used to speed up development. The script is located in Demo App root directory.

The script performs the following tasks for the honeywell plugin project:
1. Extract the action from all files unter `/actions/`.
2. Basic checking for correct naming scheme of `ACTION_NAME`. A valid `ACTION_NAME` is
	```
	public static final String ACTION_NAME = "nameOfTheAction";
	```
3. Update honeywell project `honeywell.js` with all actions.
4. Update the honeywell project `plugin.xml` with all source files.

You can also update the Honeywell plugin in the Cordova Demo project located under path with the additional command line argument `--reload`.
